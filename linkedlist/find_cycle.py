"""
Try solving it using constant additional space.

Constraints:

0 <= size of linked list <= 106
1 <= value of nodes <= 109

Example:

Input: 
                  ______
                 |     |
                 \/    |
        1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4

Return the node corresponding to node 3. 



Expected Output
Enter your input as per the following guideline:
There are 2 lines in the input

Line 1 ( Corresponds to arg 1 ) : Elements in the linked list. First number S is the number of nodes. Then S numbers follow indicating the val in each of the nodes in sequence
	For example, LinkedList: "5 --> 9 --> 7" will be written as "3 5 9 7"(without quotes).

Line 2 : Integer X corresponding to a node position. If the integer is -1, then there is no loop. Otherwise, the end node has a next edge to node number X.
	For example, Integer: "-1" will be written as "-1"(without quotes).
